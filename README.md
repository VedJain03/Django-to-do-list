# Django-to-do-list

This is a locally hosted to-do list created using Django and HTML in a virtual environment. 

The program has the following capabilities:
  - Create a new list with title
  - Create a new item with title, description, and due date under a specific list
  - Edit list title
  - Edit item title, description, and due date
  - Delete list
  - Delete item
  - All underlined fields have links leading to other pages

requirements.txt has the software specifications used to run this program

Note: This is just a project I did in order to familiarize myself with Django and HTML, and there are definitely a lot of potential capabilities to be implemented in the future.
